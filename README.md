# Web-Map
 Making a web-map using python, the folium module as well as pandas to hold our data.

 When ran the covidMap.py will create three different maps displaying the total active cases, the new deaths from today, and the new cases from today. Currently the data is a bit skewed due to the United States having really high numbers in comparison to other countries.

 Any future plans for updates include being able to click the country and see the number of new and active cases/deaths the only issue I had with doing this in this time being is my json file that held the coordinates had the countries in a different order than my json file that held me covid19 data and I didn't want to manually input all the coordinates.
